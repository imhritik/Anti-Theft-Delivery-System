# Anti-Theft-Delivery-System
5th Semester Python and IoT Project 
Receiving deliveries these days has become such a hassle. You're far from home. Delivery executive arrives at your house, on figuring that you're unavailable, he leaves and rescheduling is a total another story.
But fear no more. Because now we bring to you, our college project - Anti Theft Delivery System, A Smart Package Delivery System.
With this system, you no longer have to worry about being unable to receive your deliveries. Because our delivery (box) equipped with smart sensors does all the work for you and more.
The door of the box is equipped with a camera and an RFID reader.

The delivery executive will have an RFID tag attached to the package which can be used to open the gate and place the package. And once the package is delivered and the door is locked. You will receive an email regarding successful delivery
Whenever someone comes in the vicinity of the box+++, the PIR sensor detects the person's presence and takes pictures of the person and uses facial recognition to check if the face is of the owner.
If an unknown person tries to open the box, an email will be sent to you, attached with pictures of the threat/person.
